Achived:
    Make a calculator with different kinds of questions.
        Each opperation must be in DIFRENT FILES
        Add normal opperations
        Add Pythagoreans theorem (S^2=H^2+L^2)
        (normal operators in one file, Pythagoreans theorem in another, and one file for running them both)

        I want to be able to chose another type of questions after I have completed a calculation

Must Complete:
    As a BIG challenge i want you to add trigonometry without using their direct functions.
