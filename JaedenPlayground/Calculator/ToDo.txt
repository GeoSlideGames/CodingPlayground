Achieved:
    Add normal/basic calculator operations
    Add Pythagoreans theorem (S^2=H^2+L^2)
    Each operation must be in DIFFERENT FILES (normal operators in one file, Pythagoreans theorem in another, and one file for running them both)

    I want to be able to choose another type of question after I have completed a calculation

Must Complete:
    If side is larger than slant in pythagorean theorem, send error
    If an empty or letter input is given, send error (syntax error, try again)
    Merge remainder function into division function

    As a BIG challenge i want you to add trigonometry without using their direct functions.
